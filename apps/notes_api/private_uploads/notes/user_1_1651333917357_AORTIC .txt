Stent graft therapy for aortic aneurysms is a valuable alternative to open aortic repair, especially in older sicker patients with large aneurysms. Continued device improvements coupled with an enhanced understanding of the important role of aortic pathology in determining therapeutic success will eventually permit ESGs to be a more durable treatment of aortic aneurysms.
